            Fresh Black offers a range of coffee-related products and services:
            selling high-quality coffee beans, selling the Morning capsule
            coffee machine, renting coffee machines for cafés and other
            businesses, providing maintenance and repair services for coffee
            machines, operating a barista school where professionals learn to
            work with coffee. Most importantly, introducing people to real,
            high-quality coffee beans. <br />
            In this project I worked to create a user-friendly e-commerce site.

        After a detailed analysis of the existing Fresh Black website, I
        identified several areas that needed improvement. I reviewed the
        homepage and navigation, product pages, checkout process, shopping cart,
        and the mobile version of the site. Additionally, I assessed and
        documented how easy it was to place an order through the website.

                During the research, my team and I were focused on analyzing the
                current user experience on the Frech Black Coffee website. We
                identified several key issues impacting conversion and user
                engagement. We proposed targeted UX solutions to optimize the
                core processes:
              </p>
              <li>
                Optimizing the order process: simplifying the purchase steps
                will allow users to complete their orders faster and easier,
                contributing to increased conversion rates
              </li>
              <li>
                Improving the catalog structure: we recommended updating the
                navigation and product categories for easier search and better
                product visibility, enabling users to find what they need more
                efficiently
              </li>
              <li>
                Enhancing the user interface convenience: based on the real
                needs of customers, we developed changes that reduce user errors
                and improve overall site interaction
